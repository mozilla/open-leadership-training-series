### Collaboration as Conversation

Good collaboration is a back and forth process, like a conversation, or a call and response. It’s not complicated, but you need to know the steps and the roles for contributor and lead. The series of videos below walks you through a workflow for collaboration on open projects, and demonstrates good communication with contributors. Watch closely, because you’ll be doing these steps (and playing both roles) yourself in the assignments at the end of this module! We’ve included screenshots in the assignment section to help you along.

If you master this workflow and practice it in your community, contribution can happen more smoothly and be more satisfying for all involved. You, the project lead, need to move this whole process forward! These handy tips should help.

*   Acknowledge when a new issue is posted by a contributor (remember, both contributors and project leads can post issues!)
*   Notify users when you start and finish work
*   Summarize the state of the issue
*   Give periodic status updates
*   Inform everyone if you slip
*   Inform everyone if you’re on track
*   Make responsibility handoffs clear
*   Notify when new functionality is added to the project, and when fixes are made
*   Always use friendly tone and correct grammar to increase legibility
*   Talk to users on their terms, follow their cues

### Writing Great Messages and Comments on GitHub

Your communications on GitHub don’t need to be literary masterpieces, but it’s really helpful if they are clear and well-written. Remember the history of your document is a timeline of commits. Each "commit message" is the backstory of your changes. A good, comprehensible, useful "commit message" is one that fills in that story. It lets collaborators and the project owner/lead know what you've done, what changes you’ve made, what you’ve added. This includes your own commits as project lead. While you might know the ins and outs of any change you made at the moment, in 5 days or 5 weeks or 5 years, those details will probably have slipped your mind. A detailed commit will capture that information forever.

When you’re writing commit messages, you’ll want to make them short, clear, and in a fairly uniform format so they're easy to read. Here are a few rules for writing messages like these, taken from this excellent blog post, [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), by Chris Beams. Read the post to learn about the rationale behind each rule.

1.  Separate subject from body with a blank line
2.  Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3.  Capitalize the subject line
4.  Do not end the subject line with a period
5.  Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6.  Wrap the body at 72 characters
7.  Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

For example: 

This is an example on how to write a proper commit message while contributing
                //Notice here the capitalisation of the header and the absence of a period in the commit header

The paragraphs should contain enough information about the changes commited and what is all it is about. 

There should be a line space between each paragraph. Describe about the functions you have used in the changes you have committed. Write what was wrong with the code and how did you fix it.
