### Description
Thinking about what you eventually want to achieve with your project is a good way to understand what are the core things you need to focus time and energy on. Roadmapping is a tool to visualize this and create defined actionable steps that will help you and contributors to know exactly what to work on and the current stage of development.

### Goals of the week
Define a roadmap of actionable steps towards your project goal, to be assessed by the program experts.

### Content
- What defines a Roadmap?
- How to measure a process and define milestones?
- Time management

### Assignments

- Define a clear final goal you want to achieve with your project.
- “Reverse-plan” and list the actions, responsibilities and timeline for achieving your goal.
- Set reasonable milestones for your project based on this.
